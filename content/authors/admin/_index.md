I am a graduate student in social psychology at Princeton University working withÂ <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/person/kristina-olson">Kristina Olson</a>. My research explores the development, perceptions, and implications of gender diversity in adults and children using wide range of methodologies, including reaction-time tasks, self-report surveys, longitudinal studies, and qualitative methods. 

I believe that the most powerful implications of gender diversity occur outside of the academy, and am eager to partner with folks outside of psychology to further explore how gender influences our everyday lives. Additionally, I am also interested metascience, particularly as it relates to open science and reproducibility in the field of psychology. Finally, I value heterogeneity in science and in life, and strongly believe that increasing representation of diverse individuals at all levels of research begets more comprehensive and innovative science.
