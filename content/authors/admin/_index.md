I am a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.chop.edu">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</a> where I work on projects focused on transgender and nonbinary youth health and well-being with the <a href="https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/gender-and-sexuality-development-program">Gender and Sexuality Development Program</a> and <a href="https://www.policylab.chop.edu/">PolicyLab</a>. Previously, I completed my PhD in <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/">psychology</a> and <a href="https://jdp.princeton.edu/">social policy</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a> where I was an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> and member of the <a href="https://hudl.princeton.edu/">Human Diversity Lab</a>. 

I believe that the most powerful implications of gender diversity occur outside of the academy, and am eager to collaborate with folks beyond the field of psychology to further explore how gender influences our everyday lives. Additionally, I value human diversity and strongly believe that increasing representation of diverse individuals begets more comprehensive and innovative science. Thus, I am committed to practicing allyship that empowers diverse individuals at all levels of research.
